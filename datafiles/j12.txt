File Coherent [ 
Citizens of Pau,
    We have all seen the signs.  We have all seen the end coming.  Oil dried up centuries ago.  Nuclear now is not too far off do the same.  We have hit a wall with solar efficiency, and hydroelectric isnâ€™t scaling fast enough.  This is the fix, the solution to not just these dooms, but all dooms.  Corruption will be forgotten like the origins of man.  This, I promise.
~Governor Lynch
