File Coherent [
This is the end of the line.  This is the last log.  We have left you a trail, we left you a way to find us again.  Yet, we cannot allow all of humanity to reach us, for that would defeat the purpose of our escape.  Though you have reached this far, thus we will extend to you an opportunity.  Sixty seconds after this file is closed, the bridge to our world will collapse, and none may reach us. Until then, choose your Fate.
Thank you,
The Obfuscated Phenomenon
